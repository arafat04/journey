For a function of a line, the slope is the division between the change between y coordinates and the change between x coordinates.

$$
  slope \equal \frac{\delta(y)}{\delta(x)}
$$

For a line, there is only one slope. But for a curve, each point will have different slope.

However, if we want to find a slope at a point in a curve, we can not find a slope for a single point as we need two points to calculate the slope. To solve this problem, we can take another point on the curve not too far from the intial point. The reason we
